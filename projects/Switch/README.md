# Lakka for Switch (WIP)

It's a WIP of porting Lakka for the Switch.

## How to boot

1. Download an existing image file or create one yourself : `DISTRO=Lakka PROJECT=Switch ARCH=aarch64 make image`
2. Burn the image to your Switch's SD card and put it in
3. Use Painless Linux to boot !
    * The first boot will resize the storage partition and reboot

## What works / what doesn't

See the Painless Linux README for that.
